# Title: Bug Checker
I created a script in Python that uses the built-in pylint library to check for potential bugs in a Python code file.

# Summary:
This script uses the pylint library, which is a popular tool for analyzing and checking Python code for potential errors and bugs. It defines a check_for_bugs() function that takes a filename as an argument, and then calls the pylint.lint.Run() method to analyze the file and produce an output with potential bugs and issues.

To use this script, simply replace 'example.py' with the name of the Python file you want to check, and then run the script. The pylint library will generate a detailed report of any issues or potential bugs in the code, which can then be addressed and fixed.
